      <p>Represent who I am as a professional. Inform of my value by including: skills, accomplishments, and history. Take the place of a standard resume, but with greater use of visuals and photos.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Prospective Employers! They will most likely land on the page from a link in an application or LinkedIn, or other networking. I am aiming to employers who are innovative and have high standards. This will be a first impression minimalist site.</p>  <!-- change this -->
